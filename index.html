            <p>One can refine these observations based on the prediction scores obtained in each case. As explained in the Methods, these scores do not correspond to probabilities but can be calibrated based on the cross-validation results. In particular, when we trained the algorithm we noticed that if the top prediction score is greater than 40% (50%, 60%), our accuracy in predicting the authoring justice increases to 93% (95%, 96%, respectively). Similarly, the original accuracy further improves to 95% when considering the top two predictions per opinion, rather than a single one. If the sum of the top two prediction scores exceeds 50%, the accuracy increases to 98%.</p>
